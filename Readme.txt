# Weather Analysis Project

## Overview

This Python project focuses on analyzing weather data for multiple cities. The dataset includes information such as maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and cloud cover. The goal is to gain insights into the weather patterns of different cities and explore the impact of climate change on a specific city.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

1. The data, the code and the visualisations of results are all stored in the same file.

4. **Run the Analysis Script:**
    ```bash
    python src/FinalProjectv1.py argv1 argv2

    ```
Note: argv2 is only necessary for functions 4.1, 4.2 and 6
5. argv1 = name of a function that the file will execute. These are 2, 3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5, 6;  argv2 = name of a city. These are New York, London, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Beijing, New Delhi, Sydney, Paris, Berlin, Cairo
	
## Results

The visualizations and results of the analysis will be saved in the same directory as the file.
